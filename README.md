# Computing Machine

This Linux and Unix-like desktop-environment theme is entitled Computing Machine. It is for GTK+ 2/Gnome 2 applications; GTK+ 3/Gnome 3 applications; Qt 4/KDE 4 applications; and Qt 5/KDE 5 applications via the Qt5 Configuration Tool ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/qt5ct/ ).

This desktop theme is intended to be visually reminiscent of classic desktop user-environments. See the included "Information.txt" file for instructions on how to configure this theme.

The computer-desktop background/wallpaper image featured below is entitled Angel Skin, and is available here: https://github.com/Jamie-Michelle/Angel-Skin

Changes for version 17.2:

The New Year Special Edition! May everyone have crystal-clear vision for the duration of the new year and far into the future!

Improved the GTK+ 2 portion of the theme by changing "gtk-large-toolbar=16,16" to "gtk-large-toolbar=24,24" in the 'gtk-2.0/gtkrc' file. Improved the documentation by recommending the line "gtk-toolbar-style=GTK_TOOLBAR_ICONS" in the '~/.gtkrc-2.0' and/or the '/etc/gtk-2.0/gtkrc' files. Together these changes make the toolbars of the GTK+ 2 portion of the theme look the same on other window managers as they do on the XFCE desktop environment.

Keep in mind that since version 13.0, the GTK+ 3 portion of the theme has been revised and is much improved.
