# Computing Machine

This Linux and Unix-like desktop-environment theme is entitled Computing Machine. It is for GTK+ 2/Gnome 2 applications; GTK+ 3/Gnome 3 applications; and Qt 5/KDE 5 applications via the Qt5 Configuration Tool ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/qt5ct/ ).

This desktop theme is intended to be visually reminiscent of classic desktop user-environments. See the included "Information.txt" file for instructions on how to configure this theme.

Changes for version 15.0:

This release incorporates a number of improvements. Now the complete GTK+ 3 portion of the theme is defined in the 'gtk-3.0/gtk.css' file, thereby doing away with separate image files. A problem with the color-chooser's selected color not showing through the overlay has been fixed. Various other improvements have also been made.

Keep in mind that since version 13.0, the GTK+ 3 portion of the theme has been revised and is much improved.
