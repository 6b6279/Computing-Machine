# Computing Machine

This Linux and Unix-like desktop-environment theme is entitled Computing Machine. It is for GTK+ 2/Gnome 2 applications; GTK+ 3/Gnome 3 applications; and Qt 5/KDE 5 applications via the Qt5 Configuration Tool ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/qt5ct/ ).

This desktop theme is intended to be visually reminiscent of classic desktop user-environments. See the included "Information.txt" file for instructions on how to configure this theme.

Changes for version 13.0:

I completely reworked the GTK+ 3 portion of the theme. Now it's far more correspondent to classic desktop environments. For example, now the outset borders of the tabs go all the way around their tabbed pages; it now uses grooved separators; etc. The button, tab and entry borders have also been overhauled, which now use GTK+ 3's built-in CSS outset/inset borders, instead of trying to create GTK+ 2-reminiscent borders for these elements (as was attempted earlier), which created bad-looking border-corners, and which would have made attempting to create outset tabbed pages connected to their tabs a nightmare. This also simplifies the code.
