# Computing Machine

This Linux and Unix-like desktop-environment theme is entitled Computing Machine. It is for GTK+ 2/Gnome 2 applications; GTK+ 3/Gnome 3 applications; Qt 4/KDE 4 applications; and Qt 5/KDE 5 applications via the Qt5 Configuration Tool ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/qt5ct/ ).

This desktop theme is intended to be visually reminiscent of classic desktop user-environments. See the included "Information.txt" file for instructions on how to configure this theme.

Changes for version 17.1:

The Christmas Special Edition! May everyone have a splendiferous Christmastide!

Improved the GTK+ 2 portion of the theme with "GtkComboBox::appears-as-list = 0" instead of "GtkComboBox::appears-as-list = 1" in the 'gtk-2.0/gtkrc' file, which brings it more in accordance with the GTK+ 3 portion of the theme; and which is more logical since with "GtkComboBox::appears-as-list = 1", the non-entry comboboxes appear exactly like the entry comboboxes even though they have no actual entry-field. Also made some other small improvements to the GTK+ 2 portion of the theme.

Created the 'Computing-Machine.conf' file in the 'Extras/' directory, which can be used with the 'qt5ct' program in order to apply the Computing Machine color-scheme upon different Qt 5 interface styles. See the included 'Information.txt' file for instructions on how to use it.

Keep in mind that since version 13.0, the GTK+ 3 portion of the theme has been revised and is much improved.
