# Computing Machine

This Linux and Unix-like desktop-environment theme is entitled Computing Machine. It is for GTK+ 2/GNOME 2 applications; GTK+ 3/GNOME 3 applications; Qt 4/KDE 4 applications; and Qt 5/KDE 5 applications via the Qt5 Configuration Tool ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/qt5ct/ ).

This desktop theme is intended to be visually reminiscent of classic desktop user-environments. See the included "Information.txt" file for instructions on how to configure this theme.

The computer-desktop background/wallpaper image featured below is entitled Angel Skin, and is available here: https://github.com/Jamie-Michelle/Angel-Skin

Changes for version 17.9:

The only visually-rendered change for this version is to the GTK+ 3 portion of the theme. I added the '.view text' selector to a declaration block, which affects the GNOME LaTeX program, and probably other programs which I haven't tested. It seems that recent versions of GTK+ 3 have changed the color of the main text-field of the GNOME LaTeX software from what prior versions of GTK+ 3 rendered, and so this change makes said field consistent with other GTK+ 3 text-entry fields (i.e., the color that prior versions of GTK+ 3 rendered for this field).

Note that release version 17.6 implemented a number of major improvements to the GTK+ 3 portion of the theme.
