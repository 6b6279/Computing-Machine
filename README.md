# Computing Machine

This is a fork of Computing Machine (or just CMachine) by Jamie
Michelle, a "classic" GTK theme. I have made some very nomimal changes
in the GTK3 theme itself, for example, disabled symbolic icons and
on-hover highlighting. Beyond nominal changes, I have ported the theme
to GTK4; feel free to test it out and open an issue if you have any
suggestions.

My changes are, like the original code, licensed under the GPL.
