Computing Machine version 17.1 (Dec. 21, 2019) by Jamie Michelle ( https://github.com/Jamie-Michelle ). Released under the GNU General Public License, Version 2.

This Unix-like desktop-environment theme is entitled Computing Machine. It is for GTK+ 2/Gnome 2 applications; GTK+ 3/Gnome 3 applications; Qt 4/KDE 4 applications; and Qt 5/KDE 5 applications via the Qt5 Configuration Tool ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/qt5ct/ ). This theme was developed on the XFCE desktop environment.

The './gtk-2.0/gtkrc' file is a modification of the 'gtk-engines-2.20.2/themes/Redmond/gtk-2.0/gtkrc' file from https://download.gnome.org/sources/gtk-engines/2.20/gtk-engines-2.20.2.tar.bz2 (688171 bytes, MD5: 5deb287bc6075dc21812130604c7dc4f).

The './gtk-3.0/gtk.css' and './gtk-3.0/settings.ini' files are modified from files of Reactionary Creatures version of August 23, 2018 ( https://www.opendesktop.org/p/1255961/ ; ReactionaryGTKCreatures.tar.gz , 32669 bytes, MD5: 76dc59f2a7d36ceb5f26f15cf0bbe53e) by phob1an ( https://github.com/phobi4n ).

The files in the './xfwm4/' directory are modified from the 'xfwm4-themes-4.10.0/themes/default-4.8/' directory from http://archive.xfce.org/src/art/xfwm4-themes/4.10/xfwm4-themes-4.10.0.tar.bz2 (621206 bytes, MD5: eaa58362053a3549c8be0b32efd3c54f).

The './xfce-notify-4.0/gtk.css' file is a modification of the 'xfce4-notifyd-0.4.4/themes/gtk-3.20/ZOMG-PONIES!/gtk.css' file from http://archive.xfce.org/src/apps/xfce4-notifyd/0.4/xfce4-notifyd-0.4.4.tar.bz2 (536304 bytes, MD5: 9614d4f7c0790e8ab24e55896a44a8ac).

####################

If this theme is located system-wide at '/usr/share/themes/Computing-Machine/' instead of user-specific at '~/.themes/Computing-Machine/', make sure that all the files of this theme have the correct permissions, which can be done with the following command:

$ cd /usr/share/themes/Computing-Machine/ && find . -type f | xargs sudo chmod 644

####################

To enable the GTK+ 2 portion of the theme for a specific user, include the below in the '~/.gtkrc-2.0' file (using your preferred icon set and system font; and excluding the doubled quotation marks [""] used to indicate a block quotation):

""
# ~/.gtkrc-2.0
#
# Configurations for GTK+ 2 programs.

# Make sure the following file has the file-permission of 644 (-rw-r--r--)
include "/usr/share/themes/Computing-Machine/gtk-2.0/gtkrc"
gtk-icon-theme-name="Faenza"
gtk-font-name="Cantarell 10"

""

Also put the following line in the '~/.profile' file:

""
export GTK2_RC_FILES="$HOME/.gtkrc-2.0"

""

####################

'qt5ct' set on Appearance > Style: gtk2

Putting

""
QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct

""

in the '/etc/environment' file fixed a problem concerning Firefox not opening the KDE Dolphin file-manager with icons or the right theme, after an actual computer-restart.

A recommended icon set to use with the Qt 5/KDE 5 portion of this theme is Oxygen. When installed on one's system, the icon set can be selected via the 'qt5ct' program's Icon Theme tab.

Apparently the first and perhaps both of the following two lines also have to be in the '~/.profile' file:

""
export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct
export GTK2_RC_FILES="$HOME/.gtkrc-2.0"

""

In order for 'qt5ct' to work with GTK+ 2 styles, it requires the 'qtstyleplugins' software (from https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtstyleplugins , https://github.com/qt/qtstyleplugins ). On Arch Linux-based distributions, said software is the package named 'qt5-styleplugins'; on Debian-based systems, it is the package named 'qt5-style-plugins'.

Besides the 'qtstyleplugins' software for making GTK+ 2 styles work with Qt 5 applications, one can also use 'qt5gtk2' by Ilya Kotov ( https://bitbucket.org/trialuser02/qt5gtk2/ ).

Alternatively, the 'qt5ct' program does not have to be used, as one can use the following environment variable instead in the '/etc/environment' and '~/.profile' files when 'qtstyleplugins' is installed. However, one then loses the ability to select icon sets and fonts specifically for the Qt 5 applications, which will instead use whatever is set for the GTK+ 2 portion of the theme.

""
QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=gtk2

""

As an aside which might be of help in some instances, note also the following Qt 5 application switches and environment variables, which can be used in various combinations:

$ dolphin --platformtheme gtk2

$ dolphin --style windows

$ QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=gtk2 dolphin

$ QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=cde dolphin

$ QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=windows QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=windows dolphin

Additionally, contained in the included './Extras/' directory is the 'Computing-Machine.conf' file, which can be placed in either the '/usr/share/qt5ct/colors/' directory or the '~/.config/qt5ct/colors/' directory so that the 'qt5ct' program can use the Computing Machine color-palette with different interface styles (selectable under Appearance > Palette > Custom [checked] > Color scheme: Computing-Machine). In order to have dialogue button-layouts match the GTK sequence when using different interface styles with the 'qt5ct' program, set it via Interface > Dialog buttons layout: GNOME, rather than via Appearance > Standard dialogs: GTK2, which instead is best left on Default.

####################

In order to adjust the theme settings for Qt 4/KDE 4 applications, see the below program. Also see the settings files '/etc/xdg/Trolltech.conf' and/or '~/.config/Trolltech.conf'.

$ qtconfig-qt4

####################

In order for the GTK+ 2 portion of this theme to work across different window managers and desktop environments, put the following in the '/etc/gtk-2.0/gtkrc' file (using your preferred icon set and system font):

""
gtk-icon-theme-name="Faenza"
gtk-theme-name="Computing-Machine"
gtk-font-name="Cantarell 10"

""

In order for the GTK+ 3 portion of this theme to work across different window managers and desktop environments, put the following in the '/etc/gtk-3.0/settings.ini' file (using your preferred icon set and system font):

""
[Settings]
gtk-icon-theme-name=Faenza
gtk-menu-images=1
gtk-theme-name=Computing-Machine
gtk-font-name=Cantarell 10

""

Note that if the foregoing system-wide settings are instated then one does not have to instate user-specific setting in the '~/.gtkrc-2.0' and '~/.profile' files (indeed, one can do away with the '~/.gtkrc-2.0' file entirely). However, one of the above-detailed environment variables in the '/etc/environment' file should still be used.

####################

On the XFCE desktop environment, the Computing Machine theme can be selected via the Appearance program ('xfce4-appearance-settings').

On the XFCE desktop environment, the window-manager portion of the Computing Machine theme ('./xfwm4/') can be selected via the Window Manager program ('xfwm4-settings').

On the XFCE desktop environment, the notifier portion of the Computing Machine theme ('./xfce-notify-4.0/') can be selected via the Notifications program ('xfce4-notifyd-config').

The Computing Machine theme can be selected as the theme of the LightDM GTK+ Greeter ('lightdm-gtk-greeter', https://launchpad.net/lightdm-gtk-greeter ) via the Settings Editor for LightDM GTK+ Greeter ('lightdm-gtk-greeter-settings' or 'lightdm-gtk-greeter-settings-pkexec', https://launchpad.net/lightdm-gtk-greeter-settings ) when the Computing Machine theme is installed system-wide at '/usr/share/themes/Computing-Machine/'. Alternatively, one does not have to use said Settings Editor, as the theme of the LightDM GTK+ Greeter can be set by directly editing its '/etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf' file.
